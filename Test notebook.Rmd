## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Let's install tidyverse and import data.
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016 <- read_csv("Kaggle_Video_Game_Sales_Data/Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv")
View(Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016)
Data<-Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016
```

EDA 1
```{r}

```


Let's create the training and test sets for determining overall sales.
```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(0623)
test_index <- createDataPartition(Data$Global_Sales, times = 1, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
test_set <-  Orig_Data[test_index, ] 
train_set <- Orig_Data[-test_index, ]
```
